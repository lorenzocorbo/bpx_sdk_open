## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.7] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Add one-command Linux and Windows wheel build scripts that prepare reusable
  Python 3.11 environments with `uv` and run `cibuildwheel`.
- Add a Windows build option that temporarily bypasses environment and system
  proxy settings.
- Add an opt-in `BPX_SDK_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS` CMake option and an interactive
  real-robot test for verifying that the Bound gait remains selected across a
  forward, pause, and forward sequence.
- Add repository attributes that normalize text files to LF and explicitly
  classify prebuilt libraries and wheel packages as binary files.

### Changed

- Update the SDK version metadata and bundled Windows and Linux libraries to
  1.0.7.
- Refresh checked-in wheels for CPython 3.8 through 3.14 on Linux x86_64,
  Linux aarch64, and Windows AMD64.
- Document the Linux and Windows wheel build workflows in English and Chinese.
- Clarify main gait and sub-gait values, signed sub-gait interpretation, and
  Walk startup behavior.

### Fixed

- Fix an issue in the bundled SDK libraries where calling `setVelocity()`
  caused the selected gait setting to become ineffective.
- Fix swapped gait selection behavior in the bundled SDK libraries where
  `setPronk()` selected Bound and `setBound()` selected Pronk.

### Removed

- Remove the checked-in 1.0.6 wheel set. Version 1.0.7 wheels checked into this
  release cover Linux and Windows; macOS wheels remain available through the
  configured CI build workflow rather than the repository wheelhouse.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Add on-demand robot build version queries and cached version information
  after connection through the C++ API.
- Expose cached robot version information to Python and report it from the C++
  and Python examples.
- Add structured leg odometry containing body velocity, world position,
  orientation, and angular velocity in the C++ and Python APIs.
- Add CPython 3.8 through 3.14 wheel artifacts for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### Changed

- Update the bundled SDK libraries and examples for the robot version query.

### Removed

- Remove `getCurrentVelocityBody()` and `getCurrentVelocityBodyArray()`, and
  replace the legacy velocity-only leg odometry API with structured leg
  odometry.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Add release wheel builds for Linux x86_64/aarch64, Windows AMD64, and macOS
  arm64, including CPython 3.14 support.
- Add velocity, leg odometry, and maximum velocity output to the examples.

### Changed

- Update bundled libraries and wheel artifacts for SDK 1.0.5.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Add native macOS arm64 SDK library and Python package support.
- Declare Python 3.8 and later support for the packaged bindings.

### Changed

- Extend CMake and Python packaging architecture detection to macOS arm64.
- Set the minimum macOS deployment target to macOS 11.0.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Add Python 3.8+ bindings, type information, and Python examples for state,
  motion-level, and joint-level control.
- Add Windows x86_64 DLL and import library packaging.
- Add configurable command-line connection options to the C++ and Python
  examples.
- Add separate English and Simplified Chinese documentation.

### Changed

- Make the CMake examples select the bundled SDK library for the current
  platform and architecture.

### Removed

- Remove the unsupported `setForwardFlip()` and `setBackFlip()` motion APIs.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Add explicit gait selection commands for Walk, Running, flips, Bipedal,
  inverted Bipedal, Pronk, Pace, and Bound.
- Add sub-gait feedback getters.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Add typed motion state, gait, and joint index definitions.
- Add typed state and gait getters alongside the raw-value APIs.
- Add `setZeroPositionsFlag()` for robot zero-position preparation.

### Changed

- Document IMU Euler-angle and quaternion component ordering.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Initial C++ SDK for robot state queries, motion-level control, and
  joint-level control.
- Initial Linux x86_64 and aarch64 shared libraries, CMake configuration, and
  C++ examples.
